Simplechat
==========

SYNOPSIS
--------

It's a little browser chat client/server. This was written for a presentation about Node.js and Socket.IO at the Berlin HTML5 Usergroup. It doesn't do a lot of things that you might expect of a chat application, but it does provide a dead-simple UI and server backend.
